        <h3>A Speedcuber and Learner </h3>
        <p>I am prety much interested on cubing. I was in class six when I first saw a Rubik's Cube in my life. That time, I thought that it is only possible by super talented people. However, I learned to cube from YouTube. I was very much excited when I solved the cube only in 5 minutes. Since then I practised a lot and now I am Sub-25. Well, I am still practising in order to see myself in the WCA Competetion </p>
